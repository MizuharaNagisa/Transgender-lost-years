# Gender Marker Change <br>

Here’s all the information you need to know to change your gender marker on various government documents (state and federal). <br>

Massachusetts Driver’s License/State ID Card <br>

To change the gender marker on your state issued identification you simply need to submit an ID application together with a Gender Designation Change Form, signed by you attesting to the gender that you would like to see reflected on your ID. <br>

You are no longer required to submit any documents or proof of medical transition/surgery from a medical provider or counselor/psychologist. <br>

If your current state issued identification/license has a name you do not use anymore or has not been updated since you have legally changed your name, you must also bring your court ordered name change document. <br>

Amending an I.D./License will cost $25.00. If you do not have an I.D./License yet, applying for a new license will cost $50.00. <br>
